# Bots

## ClapperBot

- What does it do?

Transforms `some text that I want to be clapped` into `some 👏 text 👏 that 👏 I 👏 want 👏 to 👏 be 👏 clapped 👏`.

- Telegram usage:

inline: `@the_clapper_bot <message>`

- Why?

It's boring having to insert this clap emoji every time I want to impersonate this ridiculous way of speaking.

# Personal usage

Each bot has it's own index.ts page, there's also a `bot_tokens.json` with each bot token from `@BotFather`. Obviously removed mine but left a `bot_tokens.example.json`.

## Running

- `yarn`
- `yarn dev`
- `yarn start`
